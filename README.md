# OPMI-kpmp
The Ontology of Precision Medicine and Investigation (OPMI) terms used for the KPMP project

The [OPMI](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/opmi.html) is a community-based OBO library ontology targeted for the domain of precision medicine and its investigation. The KPMP project provides the primary use case and model system for the OPMI development. While OPMI aims to serve the broader precision medicine domain, the OPMI-kpmp is an OPMI subset combined with kidney-specific terms targeted to support the KPMP precision medicine tasks.
